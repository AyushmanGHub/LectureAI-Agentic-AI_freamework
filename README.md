## 📖 Overview

### Problem Statement

The rapid growth of educational videos in the last decade has led to challenges such as:

* **Linear Information Flow** – Hard to jump to exactly what you need.
* **Information Overload** – Too much content without smart filtering.
* **Time-Consuming Search** – Manual scrolling to find relevant sections.
* **Limited Interaction** – No real-time Q\&A or contextual summaries.
* **Workflow Breaks** – Needing to leave the platform for missing info.
* **No Personalized Feedback** – No way to measure understanding or progress.

### Our Solution

**LectureAI** takes video lecture and transforms it pssive watching into an **interactive, insightful, and personalized learning experience** using an **agentic AI framework**.
With specialized AI agents, it allows users to:

* Ask contextual questions directly about the video.
* Get timestamp-based explanations.
* Generate quizzes (MCQs) with detailed evaluation.
* Create mind maps and structured notes.
* Explore beyond-video knowledge using web search.


## 🚀 Summary of the App & Feature Highlights

* **🎯 AI-Powered Chatbot** – Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, timestamp finders, and explainers to answer queries with context.
* **📝 MCQ Generation & Evaluation** – Auto-creates quizzes with scoring, explanations, and difficulty breakdown.
* **🧠 Mind Map Creation** – Converts video transcripts into a **Graphviz-powered** visual map of topics.
* **📚 Notes Generation** – Creates structured notes with an introduction, key takeaways, and conclusion.
* **🔍 Multi-Agent Architecture** – Central LLM-based controller picks the right agent for each task, with a validation layer for accuracy.
* **⚡ Resource Creation Pipeline** – Automatically extracts raw transcripts, semantic chunks, and time-bounded chunks to power all features.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

😊 I’m always open to meaningful conversations, collaborative projects, and idea exchanges in the fields of **graph theory**, **machine learning**, and **data science**.
If you’re interested in discussing new insights, working together on related topics, or contributing to ongoing discussions — feel free to reach out!
**Let’s learn and build together 🚀**
nt me to also create a **diagram-based workflow section** for the README so it visually matches your report’s workflow figure? That would make your GitHub page much more engaging.
